<h4>Key Benefits of the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java</h4>

1. Apart from our <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/groupdocs-viewer/" target="_blank">cloud-based document viewer</a>, this version enables you to host documents locally, without sending them to the GroupDocs Cloud API.

2. Support of more than <strong>45 file formats</strong>, including PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio and more. Please see the full list bellow.

3. GroupDocs converts documents to HTML5, meaning users can view them from any modern web-browser without having to install Flash, Adobe Acrobat Reader or any other plugins.

4. High-fidelity, native-text rendering. Embedded documents look just as the originals. Users can search for, select and copy text to the clipboard right from the documents embedded to your website.

5. The viewer comes with a convenient UI that allows users to easily navigate multi-page documents in a browser. While viewing documents, users can scroll pages or turn them with a button, jump to any specified page in the document, preview pages with thumbnails, zoom in/out of the documents, print and download documents right from a web-browser.
